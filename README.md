# Sales---Performance---dashboard (Power BI project)
This Power BI dashboard was built to help a small business uncover:

✅ What products are driving the most revenue  
✅ Who their customers are (new vs returning, gender)  
✅ Which channels lead to the highest sales  
✅ When customers shop the most (hourly insight)  
✅ Order performance (cancelled vs delivered)

### 🔍 Business Problem

The business owner didn’t know:
- Why sales dropped
- Which customers were most profitable
- What product type was performing best
- When to promote or schedule inventory

---

## 💡 My Solution

I analyzed their customer, product, and order data and created a two-page dashboard:

### 📄 Page 1: Sales Overview
- Total Revenue, Total Orders, Avg Order Value
- Product type performance
- Customer segmentation (New vs Returning)
- Order status and satisfaction rate

### 📄 Page 2: Behavioral Insights 
- Orders by Hour
- Hourly Revenue Trend
- Gender split
- Discovery source effectiveness

- **DAX** (for KPI metrics and custom insights)
