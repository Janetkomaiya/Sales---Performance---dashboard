# Sales---Performance---dashboard (Power BI project)
This Power BI dashboard was built to help a small business uncover:

✅ What products are driving the most revenue  
✅ Who their customers are (new vs returning, gender)  
✅ Which channels lead to the highest sales  
✅ When customers shop the most (hourly insight)  
✅ Order performance (cancelled vs delivered)

### 🔍 Business Problem

The business owner didn’t know:
- Why sales dropped
- Which customers were most profitable
- What product type was performing best
- When to promote or schedule inventory

---

## 💡 My Solution

I analyzed their customer, product, and order data and created a two-page dashboard:

### 📄 Page 1: Sales Overview
- Total Revenue, Total Orders, Avg Order Value
- Product type performance
- Customer segmentation (New vs Returning)
- Order status and satisfaction rate

### 📄 Page 2: Behavioral Insights 
- Orders by Hour
- Hourly Revenue Trend
- Gender split
- Discovery source effectiveness

## 📈 Business Strategy Recommendations

Based on the insights from this dashboard, here are key recommendations to grow the vintage shirt business:

1. Double down on high-performing shirt variations
The data shows that processed vintage shirts outperform others in sales volume. Prioritize restocking and promoting these variants to maximize revenue.


2. Optimize marketing efforts for returning customers
Returning customers account for a strong portion of repeat purchases. Create loyalty campaigns or early-access drops to retain and reward them.


3. Focus promotions around peak shopping hours
Sales peak around specific hours of the day. Use this insight to time flash sales or social media posts for better conversion.


4. Reduce cancellations by improving order process
A noticeable percentage of orders were cancelled. Streamlining order confirmation and delivery tracking could help reduce this.


5. Leverage top discovery channels
Channels like Instagram and WhatsApp are driving most of the sales. Prioritize content and advertising on these platforms to reach more targeted buyers
